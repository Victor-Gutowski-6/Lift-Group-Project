0. The lift is idle (No requests in queue)
When the lift has no requests, it always moves to floor n/2 and waits there.
•This minimizes the average response time for future requests.
•The lift remains stationary at n/2 until a request arrives.

1. The lift has one request
•The lift moves directly to the requested floor, then stops and opens the doors.
•Once the request is completed, it checks if more requests have appeared:
•If new requests exist, it picks a direction and continues.
•If no new requests exist, it returns to floor n/2 and idles.

2. The lift has multiple requests
•The lift serves all requests in the current direction before changing directions.
•Requests are prioritized based on distance and waiting time:
•If moving up, serve the closest higher floors first.
•If moving down, serve the closest lower floors first.
•When no more requests exist in the current direction, the lift reverses direction if needed.


3. Special Cases
3.1 Two passengers at the same floor want to go in opposite directions
  •The lift only picks up passengers moving in its current direction.
  •The other request is added to the queue for later.
  •If the lift is idle it picks up both passengers and goes to the closest floor first.

3.2 A new request appears while moving
  •If it aligns with the current direction, it is inserted into the queue.
  •If it requires a direction change, it is handled after the current trip, unless:
	  •The request has waited too long, in which case the lift adjusts its route.

3.3 Long wait times:
  •If a request is ignored for too long, the lift will prioritize it to prevent starvation.


4. Implementation Considerations
  •Queues & Heaps: Used to efficiently manage and prioritize requests.
  •Handling Long Wait Times: If a request waits too long, the lift prioritizes it.
